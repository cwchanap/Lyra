# Writing Investigation Scenes (《東京雨證：第零證人》)

## Role

You are authoring **interactive investigation scenes** for the detective game. Each scene is a markdown file the player will explore non-linearly — clicking hotspots, asking characters topics, collecting evidence and statements. The format is hybrid: human-readable dialogue with structured markdown-heading blocks that map cleanly onto the scene JSON schema and investigation runtime state.

## Language convention

**Player-facing content** (everything the player sees in-game) is **Traditional Chinese**: dialogue lines, bracketed stage directions, `[場景：...]` scene tags, intro/outro narration, evidence/statement *values* (name, description, details, content). The base `writing-detective-game-dialogue` skill governs all of this.

**Author/parser-facing content** (markdown structure and metadata only) is **English**: block headings (`## Intro`, `#### On Collect`, etc.), field labels (`Status`, `Unlock`, `Reveals`, `Description`, etc.), state values (`locked`/`unlocked`), reveal target prefixes (`evidence:` / `statement:` / `topic:` / `hotspot:` / `sublocation:`), and the unlock-condition predicates/combinators (`collected`, `discussed`, `and`, `or`, ...). The parser reads these; the player never does.

## REQUIRED BACKGROUND

You MUST be familiar with **`writing-detective-game-dialogue`** before using this skill. That skill owns the base dialogue rules: line format (`**角色名**：`), ≤100 Chinese char limit, bracketed stage directions, scene tags, phone-call convention, foreshadowing discipline, Traditional Chinese rules, and the per-chapter foreshadowing allow/deny lists.

This skill describes only the **structural wrapper** around dialogue — the block hierarchy and reveal/unlock logic specific to investigation scenes. All dialogue *inside* block bodies follows the base dialogue skill's rules unchanged.

## When to use

Use when the file you are authoring is `chapter_<N>/investigation_scene_<N>.md` — i.e. the user has asked you to write the interactive investigation Part (Part 1, Part 4 in Chapter 1, etc.).

**Do not use for** `chapter_<N>/scene_<N>.md` — those are linear dialogue scenes (intro cutscenes, transitions, in-car conversations). For linear scenes, use `writing-detective-game-dialogue` directly.

**Also not for** `interrogation_scene_<N>.md` — those are authored and compiler-validated suspect inquiry and testimony cross-examination scenes. Use `writing-interrogation-scene`.

## File skeleton (canonical order)

Every `investigation_scene_<N>.md` follows this top-to-bottom order:

```
# Scene N: <title>

## Intro                         (intro narration — H2)

## Sub-location: ... {#id}       (one or more — H2)
  ### Hotspot: ... {#id}         (H3, inside sub-location)
  ### Character: ... {#id}       (H3, inside sub-location)
    #### Topic: ... {#id}        (H4, inside character)

## Evidence Manifest             (H2, optional if scene has no evidence)
  ### evidence:... {#id}         (H3)
    #### On Collect              (H4, required)
    #### On Reexamine            (H4, optional)

## Statement Manifest            (H2, optional if scene has no statements)
  ### statement:... {#id}        (H3)
    #### On Acquire              (H4, required)
    #### On Reexamine            (H4, optional)

## Outro                         (outro narration — H2)
```

## Heading hierarchy reference

| Level | Block |
|---|---|
| H1 | `# Scene N: <title>` (exactly one per file) |
| H2 | `## Intro`, `## Sub-location:`, `## Evidence Manifest`, `## Statement Manifest`, `## Outro` |
| H3 | `### Hotspot:`, `### Character:`, `### evidence:`, `### statement:` |
| H4 | `#### Topic:`, `#### On Collect` / `#### On Reexamine` (under evidence), `#### On Acquire` / `#### On Reexamine` (under statement), `#### On Reexamine` (under Hotspot) |
| H5 | `##### On Reexamine` (under Topic only) |

**Hotspots and Characters always live inside a Sub-location block.** Even single-location scenes wrap everything in one Sub-location for parser uniformity.

## Block field schemas

Field labels are English; reserved keyword values are English (`locked` / `unlocked`). IDs are English slugs anchored with `{#id}` on the heading line. Field *values* that the player sees (name, description, details, dialogue) are Traditional Chinese.

### Sub-location (H2)
- **Required:** `Status` (`locked` or `unlocked`)
- **Optional:** `Unlock`, `Reveals` (list)
- **Body:** `[場景：...]` tag (mandatory, immediately after metadata), then transition dialogue, then nested H3 Hotspot / Character blocks.

### Hotspot (H3, inside a Sub-location)
- **Required:** `Description`
- **Optional:** `Status` (defaults to `unlocked`), `Unlock`, `Reveals` (list)
- **Body:** inspect dialogue (plays on the player's **first** click on this hotspot, followed by `Reveals:` chain dialogue).
- **Optional sub-block:** `#### On Reexamine` — H4 immediately under this Hotspot's body. Plays on every click **after** the first. No new reveals fire on reexamine. If `#### On Reexamine` is absent, subsequent clicks play an engine-provided fallback line (configured in the engine, not authored here).

### Character (H3, inside a Sub-location)
- **Required:** `Role`, `Bio`
- **Optional:** none
- **Body:** none directly — container for `#### Topic:` blocks.

### Topic (H4, inside a Character)
- **Required:** `Status`
- **Optional:** `Unlock`, `Reveals` (list)
- **Body:** topic dialogue (plays on the player's **first** selection of this topic, followed by `Reveals:` chain dialogue).
- **Optional sub-block:** `##### On Reexamine` — H5 immediately under this Topic's body. Plays on every selection **after** the first. No new reveals fire on reexamine. If absent, the engine plays a fallback line on subsequent selections.

### Evidence Manifest entry (H3 under `## Evidence Manifest`)
- **Heading:** `### evidence:<id> {#id}`
- **Required:** `Name`, `Description`, `Details`
- **Body:**
  - `#### On Collect` (required) — dialogue that plays when this evidence is first added to inventory.
  - `#### On Reexamine` (optional) — dialogue that plays when the player re-opens this item from inventory.

### Statement Manifest entry (H3 under `## Statement Manifest`)
- **Heading:** `### statement:<id> {#id}`
- **Required:** `Speaker`, `Content`
- **Body:**
  - `#### On Acquire` (required) — dialogue that plays when this statement is first added to the log.
  - `#### On Reexamine` (optional) — dialogue that plays when the player re-reads it from the log.

### Intro (H2)
- **Heading:** `## Intro`.
- **No metadata.**
- **Body:** linear dialogue. Plays on scene load.

### Outro (H2)
- **Heading:** `## Outro`.
- **Optional metadata:** `**Unlock:** <expression>` — a boolean expression (same grammar as the per-block `Unlock:`) that gates when the Outro becomes playable.
  - When omitted, the Outro defaults to **auto-completion**: it plays when every unlocked hotspot has been inspected and every unlocked topic has been discussed in the scene.
  - When present, the Outro plays the moment the expression evaluates true.
- **Body:** linear dialogue. When the Outro queue empties, the engine advances to the next scene in the chapter manifest.

## Reveal / unlock syntax

All reveals are automatic chains — there is no manual "present evidence" action in investigation scenes (that's interrogation-scene territory).

### Reveal (`Reveals:`) — declared on the source

A list of things this trigger collects/unlocks when the block completes (hotspot inspected, topic discussed, sub-location entered).

```
Reveals: [evidence:cooling_coffee, statement:hayasaka_says_alive, topic:hayasaka@victim_background, hotspot:back_alley, sublocation:storeroom]
```

| Target form | Effect |
|---|---|
| `evidence:<id>` | Adds to inventory; triggers its `#### On Collect` dialogue. |
| `statement:<id>` | Adds to statement log; triggers its `#### On Acquire` dialogue. |
| `topic:<character-id>@<topic-id>` | Unlocks a previously locked topic on that character. Silent unlock. |
| `hotspot:<id>` | Unlocks a previously locked hotspot in the same scene. Silent. |
| `sublocation:<id>` | Unlocks a previously locked sub-location. Silent. |

**ID matching rule (strict):** the `<id>` in every target form must be the **exact anchor ID** declared on the target's heading via `{#id}`. If a Character heading is `### Character: 目擊者 田中誠 {#witness_tanaka}`, the reveal target form is `topic:witness_tanaka@<topic-id>` — never an abbreviation like `topic:witness@...`. The parser does string-match, not fuzzy-match.

### Unlock Condition (`Unlock:`) — declared on the locked target

Only on blocks with `Status: locked`. A boolean expression that, when satisfied, flips the target to unlocked.

**Atomic predicates:**
- `evidence:<id> collected`
- `statement:<id> acquired`
- `topic:<character-id>@<topic-id> discussed`
- `hotspot:<id> investigated`

**Combinators (use sparingly — long unlock chains usually mean a pacing problem):**
- `<a> and <b>` — both required
- `<a> or <b>` — either suffices

### Interaction: `Reveals` and `Unlock` are mutually exclusive per chain

For any locked target, pick **one** path to unlock it. Never both.

- Use `Reveals` on the source when the unlock is a 1:1 single-trigger reveal (most evidence collection, most topic unlocks).
- Use `Unlock` on the target when the unlock depends on multiple preconditions across different triggers (e.g. "after inspecting X *and* discussing Y").

Declaring both an inbound `Reveals` *and* an `Unlock` for the same target is an author error (parser warning).

### Play order when one trigger reveals multiple things

When the player completes a trigger that has a `Reveals:` list, dialogue plays in this fixed order:

1. The trigger block's own body dialogue (the Hotspot's inspect text, the Topic's response).
2. Each `Reveals` target's reveal dialogue in list order:
   - `evidence:<id>` → its `#### On Collect` block
   - `statement:<id>` → its `#### On Acquire` block
   - `topic:` / `hotspot:` / `sublocation:` → silent (the unlocked block's body plays only when the player engages it directly)

## Sub-location semantics

- **Entry point:** the first `## Sub-location:` block declared in the file is where the player starts. Its `Status` *must* be `unlocked`.
- **Persistence:** once unlocked, a sub-location stays unlocked for the rest of the scene. Backtracking is allowed.
- **Scene tag:** every sub-location must have its own `[場景:...]` tag immediately after the metadata. Different physical space → different AI image prompt.
- **Transition dialogue:** the body of a sub-location block (between metadata and the first nested H3) plays once on first entry.
- **First-entry reveals:** `Reveals:` on a sub-location triggers when the player first enters it — useful for environmental discoveries not tied to a specific hotspot.
- **Character placement:** characters belong to exactly one sub-location. If the same person needs to be in two physical areas, declare them once per sub-location with topics appropriate to that location. Duplication is accepted; it keeps "who is here right now" trivially answerable.

## ID namespace rules

- **Evidence and statement IDs are game-global.** A single ID like `evidence:blue_umbrella` may be declared in only one scene file across the entire game (one chapter, one investigation scene). Compile-time duplicate declarations are an error.
- **Hotspot, topic, and sub-location IDs are scene-local.** They may repeat across different scene files freely. Cross-scene references to these kinds are not supported.
- **`Reveals:` targets must always resolve to a declaration in the *same scene file*** — for all five kinds (`evidence:`, `statement:`, `topic:`, `hotspot:`, `sublocation:`). A reveal newly *adds* an item or unlocks a block; it requires the definition to be physically present in this scene's JSON output.
- **`Unlock:` predicates must also resolve to a declaration in the same scene file** in v1. Cross-chapter unlock predicates are disallowed (compile error). This is a v1 restriction — see the spec for rationale.

## Parser validation guarantees

The parser/validator checks the following — author with them in mind:

- Every `Reveals:` target resolves to a declared ID in the same file.
- Every `Unlock:` predicate references a declared ID in the same file.
- No circular dependencies (A unlocks B, B unlocks A).
- Every block with `Status: locked` is unlockable via at least one path (`Unlock:` on itself **or** inbound `Reveals` from another block).
- The first `## Sub-location:` block in the file is `Status: unlocked`.
- No target has both an inbound `Reveals` and an `Unlock` (warning).
- Every Sub-location has exactly one `[場景:...]` tag in its body.
- Every Evidence Manifest entry has a `#### On Collect` sub-block.
- Every Statement Manifest entry has a `#### On Acquire` sub-block.

## Workflow

When asked to write an `investigation_scene_<N>.md`:

1. **Read the chapter's `_詳細計劃.md`** in full — characters, hotspots planned, clue placement, foreshadow seeds for this Part.
2. **Check `General Plan.md`** for foreshadowing pacing — which seeds belong to this chapter, which must NOT be revealed yet.
3. **Confirm scope with the user** — which Part is this scene, what are the sub-locations, what are the must-cover hotspots/topics/evidence/statements?
4. **Sketch the block list before writing dialogue:**
   - List sub-locations in order, marked locked/unlocked
   - List hotspots per sub-location with their reveal targets
   - List characters per sub-location with their topics
   - List evidence and statements with their IDs
   - Draw the unlock graph mentally — does every locked block have a path?
5. **Write the file in canonical order** (`## Intro` → Sub-locations with their nested H3s → Evidence Manifest → Statement Manifest → `## Outro`).
6. **Self-check before reporting done:**
   - Every dialogue line follows the base dialogue skill's format (≤100 chars, bracketed actions, etc.)
   - Every locked block has either an `Unlock` or an inbound `Reveals`
   - First sub-location is `Status: unlocked`
   - Every sub-location has a `[場景:...]` tag
   - All `Reveals` and `Unlock` references resolve

## Common mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---|---|
| Hotspots written at H2 (sibling of Sub-location) instead of H3 inside | Move inside the relevant Sub-location block |
| Topic dialogue written as separate H3 outside its Character | Nest Topic blocks as H4 under their Character (H3) |
| Sub-location missing its own `[場景:...]` tag | Add one — every physical area needs its own image prompt |
| Locked block with neither `Unlock` nor inbound `Reveals` | Add a path; otherwise it's permanently locked |
| Locked block with BOTH `Unlock` and inbound `Reveals` | Pick one; remove the other |
| First sub-location declared as `Status: locked` | Set to `unlocked` — the player must be able to enter |
| Evidence Manifest entry without `#### On Collect` | Add it; even one short line is required |
| Manifest entries placed inline under their producing hotspot/topic | Move to the dedicated `## Evidence Manifest` / `## Statement Manifest` sections near the file bottom |
| Inline dialogue describes "present this evidence to the witness" | That belongs in the separate `interrogation_scene_<N>.md` format covered by `writing-interrogation-scene`; investigation scenes only collect, not confront |
| Dialogue line >100 Chinese characters | Split per the base dialogue skill |
| Action/expression written into a dialogue line | Move to a `[ ]` bracket on its own line |
| Field labels written in Chinese (e.g. `**狀態：**`) | Use English labels (`**Status:**`); only field *values* are Chinese |

**Note on locked blocks:** locked sub-locations, hotspots, and topics are entirely hidden from the player until their unlock condition is satisfied. There is no "locked, look later" hint shown in-game. The `Unlock:` expression is parser-internal — it determines *when* the block becomes visible, never displayed.

## Related scene type

Confrontation (presenting evidence to characters / statements), deduction slot filling, and testimony cross-examination are **not** part of investigation scenes. They belong to the separate authored and compiler-validated `interrogation_scene_<N>.md` file format covered by `writing-interrogation-scene`.
